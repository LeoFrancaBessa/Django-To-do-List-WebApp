## Overview
This is a to-do list application made with the Django framework. It has the function of add, edit or delete tasks. It also contains a login and registration page.

## Motivation
The main motivation for this project is to test my Django skills, since it is my first contact with the framework. Later, I'm planning on build more complex applications.
